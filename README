## Welcome to C-noise ! 

C-noise is an open source noise generation program which allows one to explore the colors of noise. 

* Listen to noise in real time
* Generate noise data for scientific purposes

C-noise makes use of ALSA, so be sure to have alsa-utils, asla-lib, and alsa-headers installed. To install C-noise simply do

## Volume Control
To decrease volume ... hold 9 ...
To increase volume ... hold 0 ...

## Examples: Listen to noise 

Generate 60s of white noise:
	cnoise -c white

Generate 300s of pink noise:
	cnoise -c pink -t 300

Generate 300s of pink noise with depth and alpha
	cnoise -c pink -d 15 -a 1.66 -t 300

	(depth controls the length of the autocorrelation vector, and
	alpha controls the degree of autocorrelation. Alpha is always
	between 0 and 2 and always defaults to 1.  

## Examples: Generate noise data

Generate 1024 points of azure noise
	cnoise -c azure -w 1024

Generate 512 points of pink noise and save to pink.dat
	cnoise -c pink -w 512 -f pink.dat


Enjoy exploring noise !!!
